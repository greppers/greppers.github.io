* Principia

The following is a list of principles that every document should
follow:
- Write things in [[https://orgmode.org][Org Mode]], compile them into [[https://www.latex-project.org/][LaTeX]] and share them as
  a PDF
- Diagrams should be written in a textual format such as to improve
  consistency and ensure reproducibility across every one of them (see
  the [[#tooling][Tooling]] section for more information)
