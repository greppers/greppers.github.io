#+INDEX: Project Specification

#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage{parskip}

* Abstract

This project and the applications that compose it aim to address the
/Quality Education/ goal from the United Nations' 2030 Agenda.

Sustainable Development is a call to action, and an active program to
end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity and peace for
all people, through the combination of manpower of all nations, in all
domains, to hopefully alleviate the issues we currently face.

This project seeks to integrate cloud technologies with the
educational system by providing a platform dedicated to the journaling
of open scientific documents, ranging from research papers to books
and literature.
