* Abstract

This project and the applications that compose it should provide
unlimited access to our in-house cloud infrastructure. 

The application we intend to develop should follow a software as a
service (SaaS) model targeting one important resolution from the
United Nation's 2030 Agenda.

As such, access to the platform should be seamless and work on any
device, it should not require any maintenance nor installation from
the user. The application should also be able to handle large amounts
of traffic and the infrastructure should scale vertically and
horizontally as needed.

The infrastructure should imperatively follow an open source model and
utilize open source applications, offering orchestration capabilities
similar to those of the Microsoft Azure platform. Though, it should
not make any assumptions or depend on any specific hardware
configuration.

In case of any hardware failures, the pre-defined disaster recovery
plan should take effect, and in turn, the chances of a data
discrepancy or storage disk failure affecting the underlying
infrastructure dramatically decrease.

** Adjacent software utilities

*** Optimizing virtual machine provisioning

Provisioning virtual machines is an astoundingly repetitive task for
any cloud infrastructure, however it remains one of the more
time-consuming tasks that can be performed.

We should explore a solution that addresses this challenge[fn:1], whilst
meeting the following criteria:
- Agentless architecture
- Provision, configure and deploy  
- Open source
- Cross platform
- Remote access via standardized communications protocols
  
*** Orchestrating the web application

The orchestration tool that manages the web application in question
should satisfy the following needs:
