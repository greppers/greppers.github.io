* Introduction

OpenStack is

- an industry standard cloud computing infrastructure software project
- a composable system for creating and managing massively scalable
  clouds
- /the/ operating system of your cloud infrastructure

** Architecture

OpenStack follows a modular architecture; it provides you with all of
the necessary tools to construct your own cloud infrastructure,
e.g. orchestration, clustering, virtualization, networking,
monitoring, alarming, cost tracking, etc.

** Just like LEGOs

OpenStack's individual components fit together like LEGOs, except it's
more complicated.

Every service exposes an API for programmability and integration with
other services.

* Components

Let's have a look at the tools we'll be using to build our own
infrastructure on top of OpenStack.
